HAVING before or without GROUP BY ? \u00b6 Note AFAIK these are rarities you will never see outside the exam. However I encountered at least a few questions on my first attempt that had possible answers which included: HAVING before a group by, and HAVING without a GROUP BY . Docs 1 HAVING before a GROUP BY \u00b6 HAVING can become before or after GROUP BY and it has zero impact on your query. The only general requirement is that they each come after the WHERE (if it exists) and before the ORDER BY . AFAIK they are the only two query clauses where the order doesn't matter. HAVING without GROUP BY \u00b6 HAVING can be used without GROUP BY , but it is heavily restricted. If you omit group by , all the rows not excluded by the where clause return as a single group. Since you can only get a single group, you will only ever get a single row as a return. Remember where filters rows, but having filters groups. In this case though, there's only one group to be filtered. So HAVING , in this GROUP BY -less statement will either keep the single row of aggregated output or filter it out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 FROM ON JOIN WHERE GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY FETCH 1 2 SELECT MAX ( SAL ), 'wgu' , COUNT ( * ) ct , min ( COMM ) min , median ( deptno ) med from emp ; MAX(SAL) 'WGU' CT MIN MED 5000 wgu 16 0 20 1 2 3 SELECT MAX ( SAL ), 'wgu' , COUNT ( * ) ct , min ( COMM ) min , median ( deptno ) med from emp having avg ( SAL ) > 500 ; Interval Literals \u00b6 Oracle 12c Interval Literals Docs 2 Note Seeking to answer valid ways to specify interval literals. My first attempt had at least a couple questions that tested to see if you knew the exact way to specify time interval literals, what they allowed, and different ways to get the same answer. the exam. How to format the strings that go into Interval literals? Things like: \u00b6 DAY YEAR , AS DAY TO SECOND , as hour to min , as hour to second 12:00 , 12 00 , 12:00:00 ? Interval Precisions Much like other data types, time intervals have default precision values that can't be exceeded by default. INTERVAL literals: YEAR , MONTH , DAY , HOUR , and MINUTE : \u00b6 Default precision: 2 Min precision: 0 Max Precsion: 9 Whole numbers as strings only, no decimals Zeros can exceed precede other digits up to 9 ignoring actual precision EACH keyword is NOT plural: ie using DAYS instead of DAY will throw an error INTERVAL literals: SECOND ( HEAVILY differs from the previous INTERVAL literals): \u00b6 Encouraged to read the offical docs on SECOND Get ready for a mind-fuck There is now two possible precisions: leading precision and fractional_seconds_precision leading_precision \u00b6 How many digits are available for the whole number Default: 7 You won't find this number in any docs, but I tested it, and that's what it is Min: 0 Max: 9 Will never accept more than 9 digits(left of the decimal) regardless of precision 123456789 SECONDS ( 9 ) will work 000000012 SECONDS ( 2 ) will work. Zeros are \"ignored\" against precision 0000000012 SECONDS ( 2 ) won't work. Soft limit on accepting 9 digits The exception to the soft limit of 9 digits is a string of only zeros 1 2 --Allows 60 zeroes before returning bad datetime/interval value error SELECT INTERVAL '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' DAY ( 0 ) FROM DUAL ; fractional_seconds_precision \u00b6 Note This is only limiting the total fractional seconds stored in the interval. It is NOT a limit that will cause an error. It is NOT like scale for NUMBER ( 7 , 2 ) The ONLY thing fractional seconds precision does, is to limit and round to the number specified Min precision: 0 ( Official 12c documentation says 1 ) Quote fractional_seconds_precision is the number of digits in the fractional part of the SECOND datetime field.

The intention appears to get a INTERVAL '5' DAY but without the INTERVAL keyword it's just a NUMBER with a column alias of DAY. Oracle allows this because DAY is a keyword, but not a RESERVED keyword 3 DAY 5 TODO \u00b6 Note I'm planning to flesh out most/all of the rest of these bullet points into sections with explanations and examples.

If you omit group by , all the rows not excluded by the where clause return as a single group. Since you can only get a single group, you will only ever get a single row as a return. Remember where filters rows, but having filters groups. In this case though, there's only one group to be filtered. So HAVING , in this GROUP BY -less statement will either keep the single row of aggregated output or filter it out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 FROM ON JOIN WHERE GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY FETCH 1 2 SELECT MAX ( SAL ), 'wgu' , COUNT ( * ) ct , min ( COMM ) min , median ( deptno ) med from emp ; MAX(SAL) 'WGU' CT MIN MED 5000 wgu 16 0 20 1 2 3 SELECT MAX ( SAL ), 'wgu' , COUNT ( * ) ct , min ( COMM ) min , median ( deptno ) med from emp having avg ( SAL ) > 500 ;","title":"HAVING without GROUP BY"},{"location":"2020/Oracle/post_attempt_1_notes/#interval-literals","text":"Oracle 12c Interval Literals Docs 2 Note Seeking to answer valid ways to specify interval literals.
